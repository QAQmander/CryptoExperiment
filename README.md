# CryptoExperiment
achivement of some crypto algorithm which are EASY and SHIT 

DES is really interesting with Y combinator and currying and partial application and so on.

(Maybe the only interesting is functional progrmming)

## Some maybe useless introduction

infrastructure: some shit except util.py

classical_crypto: real shit

DES: functional programming in DES.py and all other things are holy shit

AES: AES.py may be good for its modularity and other things are holy shit especially UI

AES_cf: Here are some .c .h and makefile are not git-push-ed as those are not finished yet, and in this directory there are so much codes for generating temporary results, which make it a great mess. But trust me in this situation, C language is better than Python not only for speed but also for type checking TAT.
(cAES has been tested in ubuntu 18.04 lts with python3.6, everything is ok. All the resource code have been pushed)
